# Monty-Hall-Simulation
This project simulates the Monty Hall Problem using Python and the Streamlit library for visualization. It illustrates how switching doors increases the probability of winning a car in a game show. Run thousands of simulations to observe the evolving probabilities and understand the problemâ€™s counterintuitive results.
